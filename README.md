# Riveter ðŸ’ª

<br>

The Riveter ðŸ’ª package measures social dynamics between personas mentioned in a collection of texts.

The package identifies and extracts the subjects, verbs, and direct objects in texts; it performs coreference resolution on the personas mentioned in the texts (e.g., clustering "Elizabeth Bennet", "Lizzy," and "she" together as one persona); and it measures social dynamics between the personas by referencing a given lexicon. The package currently includes Maarten Sap et al's lexicon for power and agency and Rashkin et al's lexicon for perspective, effect, value, and mental state. 

The name Riveter is inspired by ["Rosie the Riveter,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:We_Can_Do_It!.jpg) the allegorical figure who came to represent American women working in factories and at other industrial jobs during World War II. Rosie the Riveter has become an iconic symbol of power and shifting gender roles â€” subjects that the Riveter package aims to help users measure and explore.

## Installation

### Requirements 

- Python 3.8
- numpy
- pandas
- neuralcoref
- spaCy 2.3.9 (this version is required for neuralcoref)
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Installation instructions

We strongly recommend creating a new virtual environment. Activate this environment before installing and before running the code.

```bash
conda create -n riveterEnv python=3.8
conda activate riveterEnv
```

Download this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp.git
cd riveter-nlp
```

*Note: If installing on a Mac, you will need Xcode installed to run git from the command line.*

Install `neuralcoref` from source. This will also install spaCy 2.3.9.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.git
cd neuralcoref
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

Install pandas and download spaCy files.
```bash
conda install pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

To use Riveter ðŸ’ª, see the examples in [our demo notebook](https://github.com/maartensap/riveter-nlp/blob/main/riveter/demo.ipynb). 

This notebook includes both toy and realistic examples and all of the most important function calls.

If you want a quick start:
```python
riveter = Riveter()  
riveter.load_sap_lexicon('power')
riveter.train(texts,
             text_ids)
persona_score_dict = riveter.get_score_totals()  
```

*Note: [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-conda-environment-to-show-in-jupyter-notebooks-the-easy-way-17010b76e874) are some instructions for how to run `demo.ipynb` from the riveterEnv.*
